Dec. 20
    Fixed objects not being drawn when moved too far, was checking rect which doesn't change instead of check_position()
    Layers added
    Tinting added
    Objects can have multiple stored images, stored in dictionary
    Views stored in dictionary instead of list
    Resource dictionaries added, only handle sprites so far
Dec. 19
    Views no longer own objects
    Scale rects are now only calculated on draw and not stored
    Multiple views can be owned by a scene and on screen at once!
    Masks work!!!
        Fixed masks so objects are drawn if they have at least one of the masks, rather than all of them
Up to Dec. 17
