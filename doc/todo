Implement clock
    Should be done, not tested much yet though
Implement state
    Should probably be a collection of scenes
CoordinateSurface
    Append remove_object so that it can remove one at position or remove all at position
    Implement layers by checking if layer is higher or lower than other layers in list. Then draw in order.
        Account for overlap
    Look into using video memory
    Definitely need transparency now that I have masks
    Consider integrating insert_object_centered as a flag into insert_object
        Perhaps create secondary scene object which holds a CoordinateSurface and only displays visible parts on surface
        Can add objects directly to CoordinateSurface (GUI), or to Scene (GameObjects)
        Scene should not own CoordinateSurface. Not be initialized with one
            Fixed
            Add functionality for multiple views and operating on each view of a scene
            Implement functions for panning the views
    A large portion of this might be unnecessary (I may have been able to use subsurfaces)
        Regardless, carry on, this can be changed later on once scenes/surfaces are blackboxed
    Seems to move view way faster with bigger screen
        Apparently this isn't true
    Implement masks as lists (or flags if I can figure that out)
GameObject
    Implement flip/rotate sprite
    Implement animation
    Add get_center function
Spritesheet
    Add methods for spacing between sprites, strips that are multiple lines, etc
Implement resource dictionaries
