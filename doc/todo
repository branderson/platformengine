Implement state
    Should probably be a collection of scenes
CoordinateSurface
    Append remove_object so that it can remove one at position or remove all at position
    Implement layers by checking if layer is higher or lower than other layers in list. Then draw in order.
        Account for overlap
    Look into using video memory
    Definitely need transparency now that I have masks
    Consider integrating insert_object_centered as a flag into insert_object
    A large portion of this might be unnecessary (I may have been able to use subsurfaces)
Scene
    May or may not need scaling on pan_view
    Perhaps make 0 in scene_width/scene_height make the room infinite
GameObject
    Implement flip/rotate sprite
    Implement animation
    Add get_center function
Spritesheet
    Add methods for spacing between sprites, strips that are multiple lines, etc
Implement resource dictionaries
