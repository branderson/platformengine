Implement state
    Should probably be a collection of scenes
    Save and load
CoordinateSurface
    Append remove_object so that it can remove one at position or remove all at position
    Consider integrating insert_object_centered as a flag into insert_object
    A large portion of this might be unnecessary (I may have been able to use subsurfaces)
    Need to change tint functionality in coordinate surface to save to return a new surface, like game_objects do
    Don't use the same layer for any two objects, results in crazy drawing when they overlap. No real fix probably possible
    Add zoom function
Scene
    Perhaps make 0 in scene_width/scene_height make the room infinite
GameObject
    Implement animation
        Should be implemented but needs to be tested
    Add get_center function
Spritesheet
    Add methods for spacing between sprites, strips that are multiple lines, etc
Implement resource dictionaries
    Sprite/spritesheet functionality implemented
    Change resource dictionary to resource manager
Update the enginedocs
