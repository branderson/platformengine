Implement clock
    Should be done, not tested much yet though
Implement state
CoordinateSurface
    Append remove_object so that it can remove one at position or remove all at position
    Implement layers by checking if layer is higher or lower than other layers in list. Then draw in order.
        Account for overlap
    Look into using video memory
    Consider integrating insert_object_centered as a flag into insert_object
    CoordinateSurface does not allow things to be off screen... This is bad.
        Perhaps create secondary scene object which holds a CoordinateSurface and only displays visible parts on surface
        Can add objects directly to CoordinateSurface (GUI), or to Scene (GameObjects)
        If added to scene, objects added to coordinate_array of scene, all access functions same as CoordinateSurface
            but only adds to CoordinateSurface if in view
        Scene should not own CoordinateSurface. Not be initialized with one
GameObject
    Implement flip/rotate sprite
    Implement animation
    Add get_center function
Spritesheet
    Add methods for spacing between sprites, strips that are multiple lines, etc
Implement resource dictionaries
