    Fixed objects not being drawn when moved too far, was checking rect which doesn't change instead of check_position()
Dec. 19
    Views no longer own objects
    Scale rects are now only calculated on draw and not stored
    Multiple views can be owned by a scene and on screen at once!
    Masks work!!!
        Fixed masks so objects are drawn if they have at least one of the masks, rather than all of them
