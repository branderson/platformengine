Implement state
    Should probably be a collection of scenes
    Save and load
    Might want to change scenes to list instead of dict for draw order
    Add update function, store update values in state

CoordinateSurface
    Append remove_object so that it can remove one at position or remove all at position
    Consider integrating insert_object_centered as a flag into insert_object
    A large portion of this might be unnecessary (I may have been able to use subsurfaces)
    Need to change tint functionality in coordinate surface to save to return a new surface, like game_objects do
    Don't use the same layer for any two objects, results in crazy drawing when they overlap. No real fix probably possible
    Add zoom function
Scene
    Perhaps make 0 in scene_width/scene_height make the room infinite
    Add a looping toggle to scenes for wrap
GameObject
    Implement animation
        Should be implemented but needs to be tested
    Add get_center function
    Find some way to not have to scale every frame, uses lots of CPU
        Same with rotate
Spritesheet
    Add methods for spacing between sprites, strips that are multiple lines, etc
Implement resource dictionaries
    Sprite/spritesheet functionality implemented
    Need a way to load fonts at the proper size
    Don't render fonts a lot
Update the enginedocs
Implement dirty rect animation
